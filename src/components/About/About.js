                        Yia sas! I'm Emmanuel, a Full-Stack Web Developer with an entrepreneurial spirit honed through years of leading a thriving restaurant.
                        Hospitality taught me that every second counts, that proper strategies can make or break the night, and that adaptability is the secret ingredient to success.
